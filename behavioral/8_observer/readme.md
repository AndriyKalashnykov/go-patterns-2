Context:

    The Observer pattern is used when there is a one-to-many relationship
    between objects, where changes in one object need to be propagated to
    multiple other objects. It allows these dependent objects to be notified 
    and updated automatically when the state of the observed object changes.
    
Solution:

    The Observer pattern involves two main components: the Subject and the
    Observers. The Subject is the object being observed, and it maintains a list
    of Observers that are interested in its state. The Observers register
    themselves with the Subject and receive updates when the Subject's state
    changes.
    
    When the state of the Subject changes, it notifies all registered Observers
    by invoking a predefined method. This method is implemented by the
    Observers, allowing them to update their state or perform any necessary
    actions based on the new state of the Subject.

    This decoupling between the Subject and the Observers allows for a flexible
    and loosely coupled design. The Subject does not need to have direct
    knowledge of the Observers, and new Observers can be added or removed
    without affecting the Subject or other Observers.
    
Variants:

    There are a few variants of the Observer pattern that can be used depending
    on the specific requirements of the system:
    
    - Push vs. Pull: In the push variant, the Subject sends the updated state
    directly to the Observers. In the pull variant, the Observers request the
    updated state from the Subject when they need it. The choice between push
    and pull depends on factors such as the complexity of the state and the
    frequency of updates.
    
    - Event-driven: In event-driven systems, the Observer pattern is often used
    to handle events and notifications. Events are generated by a source object
    and are propagated to interested Observers, allowing them to react
    accordingly.
    
    - Reactive programming: Reactive programming frameworks and libraries often
    implement the Observer pattern to handle streams of data and events.
    Observers subscribe to these streams and react to changes in real-time.
    
Relation:

    The Observer pattern can be related to other patterns in the following ways:

    - Mediator Pattern: The Mediator pattern can be used in conjunction with the
    Observer pattern to decouple the communication between objects. The Mediator
    acts as a central hub, coordinating the communication between the Subject
    and the Observers.
    
    - Publish/Subscribe Pattern: The Publish/Subscribe pattern is a variation of
    the Observer pattern where the Observers subscribe to specific types of
    events or messages. The Subject, known as the Publisher, publishes events or
    messages, and the Observers, known as Subscribers, receive and handle these
    events.
    
    - MVC Pattern: The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern often incorporates
    the Observer pattern. The Model represents the Subject, and the Views
    represent the Observers. When the Model's state changes, it notifies the
    Views to update their presentation.
    
In summary, the Observer pattern provides a way to establish a one-to-many
relationship between objects, allowing them to be notified and updated
automatically when the state of the observed object changes. It involves the
Subject and Observers, where the Subject maintains a list of Observers and
notifies them of state changes.

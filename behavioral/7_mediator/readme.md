Context:

    The Mediator pattern is used when a set of objects need to communicate with
    each other in a loosely coupled manner. In a complex system, direct
    communication between objects can lead to tight coupling and increased
    complexity. The Mediator pattern helps to centralize and control the
    communication between objects, reducing dependencies and making the system
    more maintainable.
    
Solution:

    The Mediator pattern introduces a mediator object that encapsulates the
    communication logic between a group of objects. Instead of objects directly
    communicating with each other, they communicate through the mediator. This
    promotes loose coupling and allows for easier modification and extension of
    the system.
    
    The mediator acts as a central hub, receiving messages from objects and
    distributing them to the appropriate recipients. It knows about the
    individual objects and their responsibilities, enabling it to coordinate
    their interactions. This way, objects don't need to have direct knowledge of
    each other, reducing dependencies and making the system more flexible.
    
Variants:

    There are a few variants of the Mediator pattern that can be used depending
    on the specific requirements of the system:
    
    - Event-Driven Mediator: In this variant, the mediator uses an event system to
    facilitate communication between objects. Objects can subscribe to specific
    events and the mediator triggers those events when necessary. This allows
    for a more decoupled and asynchronous communication model.
    
    - Colleague-Specific Mediator: In this variant, the mediator is tailored to
    handle specific interactions between certain groups of objects. It can have
    different mediator implementations for different groups of objects, allowing
    for more fine-grained control over the communication.
    
    - Mediator with State: This variant extends the basic Mediator pattern by
    introducing a state management mechanism. The mediator keeps track of the
    state of the objects and adjusts the communication flow accordingly. This
    can be useful when the behavior of objects depends on certain conditions or
    states.
    
Relation:

    The Mediator pattern can be related to other patterns in the following ways:

    - Observer Pattern: The Mediator pattern can be seen as an extension of the
    Observer pattern. While the Observer pattern focuses on one-to-many
    communication, the Mediator pattern handles many-to-many communication. The
    Mediator acts as a central hub, coordinating the interactions between
    multiple objects.
    
    - Singleton Pattern: In some cases, the Mediator object is implemented as a
    singleton to ensure that there is only one instance managing the
    communication between objects. This can be useful when there should be a
    single point of control for the system's interactions.
    
    - Facade Pattern: The Mediator pattern can be used in conjunction with the
    Facade pattern to simplify complex systems. The Mediator acts as a facade,
    providing a simplified interface for objects to communicate with each other.
    This reduces the complexity and dependencies between objects.
    
In summary, the Mediator pattern provides a way to centralize and control the
communication between objects in a system. It promotes loose coupling, reduces
dependencies, and makes the system more maintainable. It can be implemented in
different variants depending on the specific requirements of the system. The
Mediator pattern can also be related to other patterns such as Observer,
Singleton, and Facade.

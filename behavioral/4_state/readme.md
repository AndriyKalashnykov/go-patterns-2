Context:

    The State pattern is used when an object's behavior needs to change based on
    its internal state. It allows an object to alter its behavior dynamically by
    changing its internal state, without changing its class or the code that
    uses it.

    When an object's behavior needs to change based on its internal state, a
    common approach is to use if-else statements to handle different cases.
    However, as the number of states and behaviors increases, this approach
    becomes cumbersome and leads to code that is difficult to maintain and
    extend.
    
    Adding numerous if-else statements can result in code that is hard to read,
    understand, and modify. It violates the Open-Closed Principle, as each new
    state or behavior requires modifying the existing code, potentially
    introducing bugs and making the codebase more fragile.
   
Solution:

    The State pattern offers a more elegant and maintainable solution. By
    encapsulating each state's behavior in separate State objects, the pattern
    eliminates the need for extensive if-else statements. Instead, the Context
    object delegates the behavior to the current State object, which
    encapsulates the behavior associated with that state.
    
    This approach adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle, as each State
    object is responsible for its own behavior. It also promotes loose coupling
    between the Context and the State objects, as the Context only needs to know
    about the State interface, not the specific implementations.
    
    The State pattern provides several benefits over using if-else statements:

    - Improved readability: The State pattern makes the code more readable and
    understandable by separating the behavior of each state into its own class.
    This improves code organization and makes it easier to comprehend the logic
    of each state.
    
    - Enhanced maintainability: With the State pattern, adding new states or
    modifying existing ones becomes easier. New states can be added by creating
    new State classes without modifying the existing code. This promotes code
    reuse and makes the system more maintainable and extensible.
    
    - Reduced complexity: The State pattern simplifies the code by removing the
    need for complex if-else statements. Each state's behavior is encapsulated
    within its own class, making the codebase more modular and easier to manage.
    
    - Improved testability: The State pattern facilitates unit testing by
    allowing each state's behavior to be tested independently. This isolation of
    behavior makes it easier to write focused and targeted tests for each state.
    
    By using the State pattern, the codebase becomes more flexible, modular, and
    maintainable. It promotes better separation of concerns and allows for
    easier addition of new states or modifications to existing ones. Overall,
    the State pattern provides a cleaner and more scalable solution compared to
    using extensive if-else statements.

    **The State pattern involves two main components**: 
    - the Context 
    - and the State.

    The Context represents the object whose behavior is influenced by its
    internal state. It maintains a reference to the current State object and
    delegates the behavior to that State object.
    
    The State interface defines a set of methods that encapsulate the behavior
    associated with each state. Each concrete State class implements these
    methods to provide the specific behavior for that state.

    The Context object can change its internal state by setting a new State
    object. This allows the Context to change its behavior dynamically based on
    its current state. The Context delegates the execution of methods to the
    current State object, which encapsulates the behavior associated with that
    state.
    
Variants:

    There are a few variants of the State pattern that can be used depending on
    the specific requirements of the system:

    - Context-driven state transition: In this variant, the Context object
    drives the state transitions based on its internal logic or external events.
    It determines when to switch to a new state based on certain conditions or
    triggers.
    
    - State-driven state transition: In this variant, the State objects
    themselves determine the state transitions. Each State object knows which
    state to transition to next based on the current state and the input it
    receives.
    
    - Hierarchical state machine: In complex systems, a hierarchical state
    machine can be used to represent states and state transitions. This allows
    for more granular control over the behavior of the object based on its
    internal state.
    
Relation:

    The State pattern can be related to other patterns in the following ways:

    - Strategy Pattern: The State pattern is similar to the Strategy pattern in
    that both involve encapsulating behavior and allowing it to be changed
    dynamically. However, the State pattern focuses on encapsulating behavior
    based on internal state, while the Strategy pattern focuses on encapsulating
    interchangeable algorithms.
    
    - State and Singleton: In some cases, the State pattern can be combined with
    the Singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of each State object
    exists. This can be useful when the State objects don't have any
    state-specific data and can be shared across multiple Context objects.

    - State and Decorator: The State pattern can be combined with the Decorator
    pattern to add additional behavior or functionality to the Context object
    based on its current state. The Decorator can wrap the Context object and
    modify its behavior dynamically.
    
In summary, the State pattern allows an object to change its behavior
dynamically based on its internal state. It involves a Context object that
maintains a reference to the current State object and delegates behavior to it.
The State objects encapsulate the behavior associated with each state. The
pattern provides flexibility and extensibility by allowing new states to be
added without modifying existing code.

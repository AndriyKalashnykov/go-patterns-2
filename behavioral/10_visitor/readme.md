Context:

    The Visitor pattern is useful when you need to define new operations on an
    object structure composed of classes that are difficult to modify, like
    third party classes or legacy code. 
    
    By encapsulating the new behavior in a Visitor, you can add new operations
    without changing the existing element classes.
    
Solution:

    - Define a Visitor interface declaring visit methods for each Element type

    - Each ConcreteVisitor implements the visit methods to perform specific
      operations

    - The Element interface declares an accept(Visitor) method to direct a
      visitor to itself

    - Each ConcreteElement implements accept() by calling the visitor's visit
      method

    - Client creates ConcreteVisitor and passes it to object structure root
      which propagates it to all child elements

Variants: 

    - Accumulate aggregate results across structure
    - Track state during traversal of structure 
    - Break encapsulation by allowing Visitor to directly access element state
    - Double Dispatch to call appropriate method based on two types 

Relations:

    - Adheres to Open/Closed principle - new Visitors can be added without
      modifying Elements
    - Can centralize related behavior that needs to span many classes
    - Complexity increases as structure evolves or more operations need to be added

In summary, the key point is that Visitor allows you to encapsulate new
operations on an object structure without changing the existing classes, which
is useful for crosscutting concerns and evolving requirements.
